            <h1>From Koson to Healthcare: Why medicine?</h1>
        </div>
        <p>In the dusty alleyways of Koson, where the scent of samsa—a crispy, savory beef-filled pastry—lingers in the air, my journey toward medicine began with my “Bobojon.”
Before coming to the U.S., I lived in a rural village town in Uzbekistan- a land where the cement floor would be sizzling hot on summer days and ice cold during short winter days.</p>

        <p>No matter how hot and boiling the weather felt, people traveled hours, sometimes by foot, to visit my grandfather for treatment not only because of his skillset, but also because of his empathy and compassion.</p>

        <p>Despite being a doctor, my grandfather did not live a very comfortable or easy life as people would often assume. My grandfather couldn't walk and was in a wheelchair for my entire life of knowing him and prior. He had been in a debilitating accident that left him paralyzed from the waist down. In a town that wasn’t technologically advanced, he couldn't travel far, and we didn’t have the resources to get him an electrical wheelchair so I can only imagine how much difficulty he experienced throughout his lifetime. Nevertheless, despite his disability, my bobojon thrived by finding ways to continue to practice as a physician. His unwavering love for medicine, along with his selfless dedication to alleviating the pain of others, despite the pain he chronically experienced, left an indelible mark on my heart.</p>

        <p>Though I met my "bobo" only once after our move to the U.S., our weekly conversations wove a thread of inspiration and his reminders of how I was his “doctor” because I lifted his legs and helped him around, were some of the most valuable memories he left me with, allowing me to see how valuable it is to be able to help people. The word “bobo” translates to grandpa, however, in my native tongue, Uzbek, “-jon” means life. We add it to words to signify that people are part of our lives and as a statement of endearment, but it had a double meaning in my case, as my grandfather was a doctor who also saved lives.</p>

        <p>It wasn't until my junior year in high school while interning at a private eye clinic that I had the humbling experiences as a volunteer in the Maimonides Health Scholar Program, that the calling of medicine resounded with me.</p>

        <p>As a result, I took an anatomy and physiology course and during the last few months of this class, my teacher encouraged us to go out and find internships. His instructions were to simply go to clinics and medical centers in our communities and hand in our resumes. He told us to be bold and even if we got rejected, we should be persistent and to keep in mind that “when one door closes another one opens.” I wanted to see how true and effective this “be bold” thing was and printed a few copies of my resume and went clinic hunting. I was rejected multiple times, every clinic had a reason for why they wouldn't hire me –– I was either too young, lacking a license, or they were not hiring, and despite this being discouraging, I decided to keep going to a few more, telling myself that I was already embarrassed once so there was no point in feeling embarrassed anymore.</p>
      
        <p>I had zero resumes left when I went into my last location. I was immediately being assessed by the boss who was in charge of hiring. She was testing my abilities on printing out my resume from their computer system and was very intrigued by my way of going into the clinic and asking to intern there since not only was I young and still in high school, I had no connections. I was interviewed by her and soon after, I started volunteering there. This was an unpaid position, so I truly just dedicated my time at the clinic to helping people and exploring my interest and passion for the medical field by observing and working with extremely skilled and passionate doctors.</p>
        
        <p>Initially, I only served as a translator for patients who had limited or no English proficiency during their visit as they spoke with the doctor, however, continuing this experience now as a scribe for the same clinic, conducting eye exams, and witnessing patient evaluations, I've deepened my understanding of the intersection of healthcare and society, fueling my interest in ways I can help both my family members who have started experiencing more struggles with their sight as they age and many others struggling with various other health conditions.</p>

        <p>In the American healthcare system, immigrants face a formidable challenge—the daunting task of navigating a system that often feels like an uncharted territory. The lack of formal education on the intricacies of the U.S. healthcare system places families like mine in a state of trial and error. Witnessing my parents' frustration, I became aware of the need for a more sustainable approach to understanding and accessing healthcare. The absence of translation services compounds the complexity, forcing families to rely on a network of acquaintances, perpetuating a cycle of confusion.</p>
  
        <p>The struggles intensify when it comes to insurance options, especially the disparities between Medicaid, traditional insurance, and the limited access to prescription drugs and specialty care. This unequal attention to the healthcare needs of immigrants and underserved communities creates an abyss, one that I have experienced firsthand in translating paperwork and navigating the system for my family since I was eight years old. Today, as a scribe in the eye clinic, I bridge language gaps, explaining procedures and medications to patients who speak Russian, Spanish, or Uzbek. Breaking heartbreaking news, like the deteriorating retinal film of a 36-year-old Uzbek man, to protect his son from having to do it, has fueled my commitment to ensuring that others won't bear the same burden of misunderstanding.</p>

        <p>The gap in healthcare representation for immigrant communities is large. Language barriers perpetuate ineffective communication and misunderstanding for immigrant patients, making unpleasant experiences when facing health problems even more nerve-wracking. I envision a future where they are treated fairly and represented equitably in the healthcare system. My commitment to service stems from the belief that everyone, irrespective of their background, deserves accessible and compassionate healthcare. The impact I hope to make extends beyond providing healthcare; it is about offering a fair chance and quality healthcare, about correcting an imbalance that has persisted for too long.</p>

        <p>As I reflect on my journey from the dusty alleyways of Koson to the immensely diverse communities in the U.S., the influence of my "bobo" looms large. His legacy, intertwined with my experiences in medicine, propels me forward with a commitment to serve underserved communities and advocate for change in the healthcare system. My journey has led me to be accepted into a pre-medical program dedicated to creating physicians that aim to serve the underserved and understand the social determinants of health in order to deliver better care, one that takes more than human biology into account.</p>

        <p>I hope to be part of a future where compassionate care knows no language barriers, where healthcare is not just accessible but also deeply understanding. My journey is not only a testament to the influence of my past but also a roadmap for a future where healthcare is a right for everyone, no matter where they come from. I hope I can make an impact on people's lives, the way my grandfather did to the people of my small town.</p>
