        <!-- Paragraph: Introductory paragraph summarizing the article -->
        <p>In an industry where storytelling shapes how we communicate with the public, who gets to tell those stories matters. Yet, the communications industry has long struggled with a lack of diversity, leaving countless voices unheard and perspectives untold. This issue has become even more pressing recently, as Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives face growing pushback. Enter CUNY Career Launch, a program designed to empower students from underrepresented communities to break into their respective fields. Launched in 2020, amid the height of the pandemic and the push for racial equity thanks to the Black Lives Matter Movement, the program has opened doors for students who might otherwise have been overlooked in the communications field.</p>

        <!-- Paragraph: Body paragraphs with detailed information -->
        <p>I recently sat down with Ava Coffee-Burks, the director of the Marketing and Communications Hub at the CUNY Career Launch. I wanted to discuss why representation is not just a goal but a necessity—and how her hub, like all the other hubs within this program, is paving the way for a more inclusive future. From tackling systemic barriers to creating opportunities for the next generation of marketing and communication leaders, programs like CUNY Career Launch are proving to be essential for creating a more inclusive future in the communications industry.</p>

        <p>Why Representation Matters in Communications</p>

        <p>Representation in the communications industry is about more than just your ethnicity or gender. As Ava explained, “Underrepresented students bring a unique perspective and lived experiences to any industry. Of course, that matters in communication, but it really matters everywhere.”
Ava emphasized further that representation goes beyond external identity.</p>

            “It's a lot of times we just think about race,” she said. “But what about lived experiences? What about, you know, where you're from? We work with international students, migrant students, first-generation students. All of these different groups bring a different perspective to the workplace.”

        </div>
        
        <p>These diverse perspectives are crucial not just for creating inclusive narratives but also for fostering innovation. Empathy and understanding are the cornerstones for creating a successful marketing campaign—or even a business memo explaining external workplace changes and their impact on employees. Empathy helps brands relate to their target audience, but this connection can only be effectively showcased in performance if the work culture reflects those values.</p>

        <p>Despite the clear value of diverse perspectives in the industry, many students from underrepresented backgrounds face systemic barriers, such as limited access to internships, professional networks, and mentorship opportunities. This is where CUNY Career Launch steps in.</p>

        <p>How CUNY Career Launch Tackles the Diversity Gap</p>

        <p>CUNY Career Launch is uniquely designed to address these challenges. One of its standout features is its focus on students with no prior internship experience.</p>

            “Our requirement of only offering positions to students who have no internship experience already opens a door for so many students,”
            <div class="author">— Shefa Giash</div>
        </div>

        <p>Ava explained. This approach levels the playing field for students who might not otherwise have access to such opportunities.</p>

        <!-- Paragraph: Results or key takeaways from the event -->
        <p>The program also provides wraparound support to help students navigate the professional world. From resume assistance to interview preparation and workplace etiquette, CUNY Career Launch ensures students are equipped with the tools they need to succeed. “We support students throughout the entire process,” Ava said. “We talk about things that might seem like common sense but aren’t common if you haven’t had that exposure.”</p>

        <!-- Paragraph: Conclusion or closing thoughts -->
        <p>While there’s no formal mentorship program, supervisors at partner organizations are encouraged to mentor students. Ava highlighted many standout employers who go above and beyond in this regard. According to Ava, what they all have in common is that they are “open to taking the steps and accommodations without our input.”</p>

         <p>Ava’s Journey: From Professional Actor to Director</p>

         <p>Originally from Little Rock, Arkansas, she began her career as a professional actor and teaching artist before transitioning into roles in finance, nonprofit work, and eventually higher education. “I’ve had a twisty career path,” she laughed. “But every experience taught me something new.”</p>

         <p>Her journey led her to CUNY, where she has worked for nearly a decade, starting as a training and development coordinator before becoming the director of the Marketing and Communications Hub. Along the way, she earned a degree in industrial and organizational psychology, which deepened her understanding of workplace dynamics and inclusion. When asked about challenges related to representation, Ava reflected on her upbringing in Arkansas, where she learned to navigate spaces where she was often the only person of color.</p>

            “In New York, it’s more subtle,” she said. “But I’ve always focused on showing up as my full self and not letting others define my worth.”
            <div class="author">— Shefa Giash</div>
        </div>

         <p>I almost felt envious of Ava when she said that. To go into a space that isn’t thinking about anyone who may look like you or share your experiences is challenging. Yet, Ava chooses to not only take up space but also believe she is worthy of the room and positions she holds. This mindset is especially vital for young communication aspirants. Based on our conversation, it’s clear that the Marketing and Communications Hub aims to uplift interns not just with skills and tools but also emotionally. The program reminds them that they, too, deserve success as long as they put in the effort.</p>

         <p>Advice for Aspiring Communication Professionals</p>

         <p>For students from underrepresented backgrounds looking to break into the communications industry, Ava’s advice is clear: take initiative and seek out opportunities.</p>
  
        <!-- Quote Section: Insert a relevant quote -->
        <div class="quote">
            “If you don’t have an internship or fellowship experience, start by doing something on your own,” she said. “Volunteer, build your portfolio, and market yourself.”
            <div class="author">— <!-- Shefa Giash --></div>
        </div>

         <p>She also encouraged students to consider smaller organizations, where they can gain hands-on experience in multiple areas. “In smaller places, you might get to do a little bit of social media, a little bit of print, and a little bit of advertising,” she explained. “Those experiences will help you stand out when you apply for bigger opportunities.” Of course, Ava also emphasized the value of programs like CUNY Career Launch. “If you haven’t had an internship, apply to Career Launch,” she urged. “It’s a paid opportunity, and it’s designed to give you that first foot in the door.”</p>

         <p>The Future of CUNY Career Launch</p>
  
         <p>As Ava approaches her two-year mark as director, her focus is on scaling up the program to reach more students, particularly freshmen, sophomores, and community college students. “We want to accept more students and partner with more employers,” she said. “We’re also working to increase our outreach to community colleges, where students often have fewer resources.”</p>
  
         <p>For Ava, the ultimate goal is to create a pipeline of diverse talent that reflects the richness of CUNY’s student body. “We’re not just looking for polished resumes,” she said. “We’re looking for potential, interest, and a willingness to learn.”</p>

         <p>CUNY Career Launch is more than just an internship program; it is a lifeline for students who might otherwise be overlooked. By prioritizing representation and providing wraparound support, the program is helping to create a more inclusive communications industry, one student at a time. As Ava put it,</p>
